Tick tack toe game
---
Console game. The first person determines the size of the game table, 
also chooses his opponent (another person or game bot). 
The first person always plays as X, the opponent plays as O. The bot 
makes steps randomly. The game starts, and players make their steps 
one by one. <br/>
When someone holds a row, a column or a diagonal, the game 
will congratulate you. Then you can decide to play another game. 
All actions start over.
